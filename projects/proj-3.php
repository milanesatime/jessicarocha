      <p>Fred Harper is an NYC based fine artist and Illustrator.</p>
      <p>Originally his two sites were half built in Wordpress and hard-coded HTML/PHP.  In order for him to make changes to his site he needed to access the database.  I decided to move everything to Wordpress so that he could update his image galleries and blog in one place.</p>
